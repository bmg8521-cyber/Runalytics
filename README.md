# Runalytics

Runalytics is a lightweight, client‑side running tracker that helps recreational and competitive runners record workouts, visualize trends, and estimate physiological metrics (VO2 and running efficiency) without requiring a server‑side database. It pairs secure user sign‑in (Firebase Auth) with local, per‑user storage and Chart.js visualizations.

**Project Vision**
- **Problem:** Many runners want a private, inexpensive way to track workouts.
- **Why this approach:** A local client app provides privacy and immediacy while still allowing a simple authentication layer (Firebase Auth) so users can keep runs separated by account.

**System Architecture**
- **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/JS served via GitHub Pages. Core pages: `signup.html`, `login.html`, `runreport.html` (run list + add modal), and `progress.html` (charts).
- **Auth:** Firebase Authentication handles signup/login flows. On successful auth the app stores `currentUID` in `localStorage`.
- **Storage:** `localStorage` stores runs under the key `runData_<uid>` (object containing parallel arrays). No server DB is used for run records.
- **Visualization:** Chart.js renders time series charts on `progress.html`.
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (branch `gh-pages`) hosts the static assets.

**Model‑View‑Controller (MVC) — logical mapping**
- **Model:** `localStorage` object `runData_<uid>` (parallel arrays for dates, miles, pace, rpe, time, hrRest, hrMax, avgHR, calcVO2, runningEff).
- **View:** HTML pages and Chart.js charts.
- **Controller:** `firebase.js` — mediates auth, input validation, calculations, storage updates, and chart re-rendering.

**Technical Stack & Rationale**
- **Languages/Frameworks:** HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript (ES modules). Chosen for minimal complexity.
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth — Quick, secure
- **Storage:** Browser `localStorage` for per‑user persistence. Tradeoff: no centralized backup or cross-device sync; benefit: privacy, zero server costs.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages — ideal for static apps, free HTTPS and CI compatibility.

**Key Algorithms & Complexity**
- **Parsing pace (m:ss → decimal minutes):** O(1) per input, constant work to split and convert.
- **Adding a run (`handleRunFormSubmission`):** O(1) work per field; then `saveUserRunData` performs a sort by date:
  - Combine parallel arrays into objects and sort by `Date` — sorting is O(n log n) for n runs.
  - Rebuild arrays from the sorted objects — O(n).
  Overall save complexity: O(n log n) dominated by sort.
- **Recomputing metrics on load (`loadAndRenderCharts`):** Iterates each run to compute `calcVO2` and `runningEff` — O(n). Uses constant extra memory per run and replaces arrays in place.
- **Chart rendering:** Chart.js draws in O(n) per dataset (drawing cost depends on canvas and Chart internal work). Memory usage is O(n) to hold series arrays.

**Installation**
You do not need Node or Anaconda to run it locally.
1. Open https://github.com/bmg8521-cyber/Runalytics.git in your browser


**Challenges & Iterations (Development History)**
- **VO2 consistency:** Multiple VO2 formulas were present; consolidated to the Uth heart‑rate method (`calcVO2 = 15.3 * HRmax/HRrest`). Implemented recompute on load to sanitize historic entries.
- **Running efficiency metric:** Standardized to `mph / avgHR` with `mph = 60 / pace` (pace in min/mile). Stored as `runningEff` with 4 decimal places.
- **Persistent sorting & corruption bug:** A previously pushed undefined variable caused corrupt saves. Fix: centralize save logic in `saveUserRunData` which combines arrays, sorts by date, and writes a normalized object.

**Security & Privacy Notes**
- Authentication: Firebase Auth only handles sign‑in. Credentials are not stored in the repo.

- Data privacy: Runs are stored locally per user.
